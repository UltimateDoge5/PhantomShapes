# Phantom Shapes Mod

The **Phantom Shapes Mod** for Minecraft introduces a tool for previewing 3D shapes.
With this mod, building 3D shapes becomes an ease, thanks to the inclusion of diverse shapes like cubes, spheres,
cylinders, and toruses.

Get the newest version on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/phantomshapes).  
If you have any problems or have an idea for a new feature, please make
