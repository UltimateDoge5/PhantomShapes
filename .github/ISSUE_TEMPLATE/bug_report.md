**Basic information**
Please include the version of minecraft and the version of the mod where the bug occurs.

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
Feel free to add screenshots if they help you with the description.

**Crash**
If you are reporting a crash, please include the crash log. The most important part is the stacktrace.
Check beforehand that PhantomShapes is included in the stacktrace. If not, this mod may not be the issue. If you're not sure, better still report. I'll still try to help either way.
